# MRI-Images-Detection-Using-Computer-Vision
 
This project utilizes deep learning and computer vision to classify MRI scans as tumor-positive or tumor-negative. Using a **CNN with transfer learning**, the model enhances accuracy in brain tumor detection.  

## Features  
- **Preprocessing & Augmentation**: Image resizing, normalization, and enhancement.  
- **Deep Learning Model**: CNN-based architecture with transfer learning.  
- **Performance Evaluation**: Classification reports, confusion matrices, and accuracy plots.  
- **Web Deployment**: Flask-based app for real-time MRI classification.  

## Resources  
- **Dataset**: [Kaggle MRI Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/masoudnickparvar/brain-tumor-mri-dataset)  
- **Code**: [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/611noorsaeed/Brain-Tumor-Detection)  
- **Pretrained Model**: [Kaggle Models](https://www.kaggle.com/models/noorsaeed)  

## Tech Stack  
Python | TensorFlow/Keras | OpenCV | Flask | HTML/CSS  

This project highlights **AIâ€™s potential in medical imaging**, improving early diagnosis and treatment planning.
